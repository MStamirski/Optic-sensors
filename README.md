# Optic-sensors
**Project description**

A company producing fiber optic sensors is going to implement the AI techniques to automate verification of produced sensors. Currently, after the production of the sensor, its characteristics should be verified each time in three reference substances: air, water and isopropanol. These procedures are expensive, so the company wants to implement AI algorithms in order to predict characteristics of a working sensor in water and isopropanol based on measured characteristics in air.

**Project implementation**

There are 4 notebooks in this project. In "FeatureEngineering" I analysed data and created datasets for training and testing models. In "ModelsWater" I trained, tuned and evaluated several regression models for prediction of measurements in water. In "ModelsIzopropanol" I did the same for the second substance.

In notebook "Summary" I included a demonstration of the concept, described implementation and presented results with conclusions.
